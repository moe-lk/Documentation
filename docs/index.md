# Education Management Software Platform

This project is building a set of software to help improve education management in the Ministry of Education. While it is being spearheaded by the Data Management division, the resulting architecture and system will be applicable to all parts of the ministry.

## Vision

The vision is to build an integrated set of systems that provide a holistic approach to manage primary and secondary education in the country. The goal is not just to be a data & information portal, but also an operational management system for day to operations of the ministry of education ranging from teacher transfers to student admissions to career management to resource allocation to planning.

**Note :** This system is concerned about operating and managing the education system and is not concerned about education itself.
