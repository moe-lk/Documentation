# NSIS : National Student Information System.

## Introduction 

The National Student Information System (NSIS) is a centralized information system which caters to every stakeholder in the general education sector. It is a web application deployed in LGC which can be accessed at the national, provincial, zonal and school level with the proper access level with different access to data. This is the first initiative to deploy a nation-wide student system. It is believed that once the system is fully operational it would automate data requirements of different stakeholders for the operation of different projects, initiate programmes to rectify situations in advance and to facilitate effective and efficient decision-making and policy formulation for qualitative education for all. Furthermore, it stimulates the operations in the education to be conducted efficiently thus reducing the wastage of resources.
